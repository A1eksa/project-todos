# Project Todos

A simple todo app made with React.js and Redux, custome made reducers and actions.
In this project i tried to work more with functionality, learning about reducers, how to structure a store, what immutabilty means trough React lens and how to work with it.
In my design inspiration i wanted to have a cheerful motivating theme.

## The problem

If i had more time i would focus more on styled components. ANd tried to give the todo app more functionality.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
