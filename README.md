# Project Todos

A simple todo app made with React.js and Redux, custome made reducers and actions.
In this project i tried to work more with functionality, learning about reducers, how to structure a store, what immutabilty means trough React lens and how to work with it.
In my design inspiration i wanted to have a cheerful motivating theme.

## The problem

If i had more time i would focus more on styled components. ANd tried to give the todo app more functionality.
